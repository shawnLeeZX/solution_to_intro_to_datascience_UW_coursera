# Introduction To Data Science Programming Assignment Solutions

## Assignment 1 - Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Python

Complete Twitter sentiment analysis that involves collecting data from the
Twitter API and computing sentiment or "mood" scores from the tweets.

Note that because of the upload mechanism of how grader works, the code in the
solution is not modulized.

## Assignment 2 - Simple In-Database Text Analytics:

* Practice typical Database operation using sqllite3.
* Matrix multiplication using SQL.
* Keyword search uses term document matrix.

## Assignment 3 & 4

I have used mapreduce before, thus I finished assignment three rather quickly
and does not include them.

As for assignment 4, I missed the notification of this assignment and does not
make it.

## Assignment 5 - R Assignment: Classification of Ocean Microbes

working with data from the SeaFlow environmental flow cytometry instrument.

A flow cytometer delivers a flow of particles through capilliary. By shining
lasers of different wavelengths and measuring the absorption and refraction
patterns, you can determine how large the particle is and some information about
its color and other properties, allowing you to detect it.

* Use R to do basic statistical analysis.
* Use ggplot to visualize data and detect abnormal in the data.
* Use packages, a.k.a. rpart(decision tree), randomForest and e1071(svm) to do
  particle classification.

## Visualization

Use Tableau to create a series of visualizations and use them to explore a
dataset about the collision of airplane and animals.
